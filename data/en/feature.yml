    In the first stage of our project, we cleaned and processed data
    related to lung diagnostics provided by
    Polska Grupa Raka Płuca and Banacha Hospital in Warsaw.
    As a result, we created the largest database in Poland, containing:

  items :
    - title : Chest X-Rays

      content : >
        2-dimensional images of chest area used in diagnosis
        of various chest conditions, lung contents and nearby organs.
    - title : CT Scans
      icon : ti-save # themify icon pack : https://themify.me/themify-icons
      content : >
        3-dimensional data providing highly detailed images
        of chest area, which allows to create different lung projections.

    - title : Patients’ History

        Supplementary tabular data describing patients’
        conditions, history, diagnosis and other medical parameters.

    - title : Interpretable Features

        Additionally created masks that show specific spots
        in an image which are important for the diagnostic purposes.
